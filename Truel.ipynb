    "Truel problem is an old problem which can be summarized as : <br>\n",
    "<font color=blue size=5><b>Several people are doing duel. <br>\n",
    "    Given their probabilities to hit, what are probability of each of them to win and who should they choose as optimal initial target ?</b></font> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This document presents solutions and analysis of different scenarios for \"classical truel\" problem - one where players can have different probabilities to hit, shoot sequentially with infinite number of bullets, and where missing is allowed. It contains several novel elements:\n",
    "* **solving for optimal targets**: solutions that not only find/show win probabilities for predefined targets, but are able to find optimal targets for each player\n",
    "* **interactive reusable solution**: interactive Python functions for fast solution and visualization, with flexible configurable parameters\n",
    "* **random choice analysis**: demonstration that \"random\" target choice can be optimal for some players in certain scenarios\n",
    "* **four players analysis**: analyze optimal targets in \"four players\" truel scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Novel part about solution is that it is fast enough to be interactive even for visualization ( where millions of individual pixels/solutions need to be calculated in short time to present AB graph with all possible hit probabilities for players A and B ). That speed was achieved by implementing default solution using mathematical calculations, while still providing option for conventional solution using simulation. Solutions support not only finding win probabilities for players with predefined initial targets, but also finding actual optimal targets - which is another novel element not found in most previous truel related papers. Mathematical solution is around 400 times faster than simulation when solving for predefined targets, and over 2000 times faster when finding optimal targets in truel scenarios. Another novel aspect of the solution is that is support more than three players, both for solutions and for visualization ( AB graphs still show all hit probabilities for players A and B, with fixed but configurable hit probabilities for players C,D... ) - although such variants are not technically \"truel\". To further improve speed and allow interactivity, Numba accelerated Python functions are used, along with 'smart' optimizations for AB graph that use dynamic interpolation/calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Novel part about truel analysis is that interactive solution was used to demonstrate situations where it is optimal for some players to choose \"random\" target, as opposed to choosing to target other players or to miss. Document also demonstrate that self targeting is not optimal choice in any situation, and confirms that intentionally missing is optimal choice in large number of cases. While analysis of intentional misses and even self targeting was done previously, it generally lacked proof or demonstration in which situation those options would be optimal choice - because most previous analyses did not solve for optimal targets. \n",

    "* **targets**: \n",
    "    - list of predefined targets that each player will choose to shoot at in initial phase of game ( while no player is eliminated yet )\n",
    "    - list where each element is one of:  A, B, C ..., Miss, Random, Self, Strongest,   Optimal  ( or alternative complex 1D targets, see below )\n",
    "    - it should have same number of elements as number of players, and for example targets= [ Miss, C, B ] indicate that player A will intentionally miss, while B and C shoot each other\n",
    "    - default empty list means Optimal for all players\n",
    "    - valid targets for each player are those that are either specific single target (A,B,C,.., Miss), can be resolved to single target (Self, Strongest) or are able to find single target (Random, Optimal) among 'Search' options\n",
    "    - if 'Random' is selected it has equal chance to select any target from 'search' list ( ignoring 'Random' option if in 'search' list ). If 'Miss' is also in search option, it has same chance as any player\n",
    "    - if 'Optimal' is selected as target for any player, solution should **find optimal target** for that player ( among options allowed by 'search' list ) that will maximize players win probability\n",
    "    - both Optimal and Random will use 'search' parameter to determine which targets are eligible/valid for selection\n",
    "    - **Alternative** way to specify target for one player is to specify exact 'Random' distribution in list of N floats (probabilities that player would select each player as target) instead of single integer constant. So for example:\n",
    "        - [ 1, 0, 0 ] is equivalent to 'A' ( player will target A with 1.0 probability, ie always). It is also equivalent to 'Self' if used by player A or 'Strongest' if used by B and player A is strongest etc\n",
    "        - [ 0, 0, 0 ] is equivalent to 'Miss' - player will not select any target\n",
    "        - [ 0.5, 0, 0.5 ] is equivalent to 'Random' if used by player B with search=[Other] - it will equally choose among A and C as targets ( each with 50% chance)\n",
    "        - [ 0, 1/3, 1/3 ] is equivalent to 'Random' if used by player A with search=[Other, Miss] -  it will equally choose among B and C as targets ( each with 1/3 chance) and remaining chance is Miss (also equal to 1/3)\n",
    "        - [ 1/4, 1/4, 1/4 ] is equivalent to 'Random' if used by any player with search=[Other, Miss, Self ] -  it will equally choose among A,B,C,Miss as targets ( each with 1/4 chance)\n",
    "    - Alternative 1D targets ( list with N floats) allow for combinations that can not be expressed with simple 0D targets ( single integer ). For example:\n",
    "        - [ 0, 30%, 70% ] is not equivalent to any simple target - here target will be randomly selected as B in 30% of cases and C in 70% of cases\n",
    "        - [ 1/4, 0, 1/4 ] is also not equivalent to any simple target - here target will be randomly selected among A and C with equal chance, but only 25% chance each while there is 50% chance to select Miss \n",
    "    - Since **targets** parameter is list of preferred targets for each player, when each player use complex target it becomes list of lists. It is also possible to mix simple and complex targets:\n",
    "        - targets= [ [0,0,0] , [0.5,0,0.5], [0,1,0] ] is equivalent to targets=[ Miss, Random, B ]\n",
    "        - targets= [ Optimal, [30%,0,70%], B ] is mixed use of simple and complex targets ( where B has uneven random selection among A and C as targets)\n",
    "    - 'Optimal' is only simple (single integer) target that can not be expressed as complex 1D target - since it is hint to solver to actually find best target for that player among all allowed with 'search' option\n",
    "    - this parameter is only meaningful in first phase of truel, until one of players is eliminated and it turns into simple duel (where players always target each other). \n",

    "    - it uses same constants as those in 'targets' , except 'Optimal' (since this is used to find optimal). In addition, it can use 'Others' - meaning any player except shooter\n",
    "    - it can only accept integer target constants, not alternative 1D list targets - since it must work for reduced number of players too. But 'Random' as simple int constant is valid search option\n",

    "Finding optimal targets and win probabilities is more complex problem than just finding win probabilities for predefined initial targets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><i>What are \"predefined targets\"  ?</i><br></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say that we have three players, customarily labeled as A (first to shoot), B (second to shoot), and C(third to shoot). And lets use probabilities to hit from original problem, so pA=1/3, pB=2/3 and pC=1.  \n",
    "That could be written as pHits=[1/3,2/3,1] , where size of list determine number of players (here three), and players shoot in order of list ( so player A is represented by pHits[0], player B by pHits[1] etc ).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's say we want to solve problem where all players will always shoot at highest threat ( which is often optimal strategy ). In this case it means A and B will target C, and C will target B. That could be written as targets=[C,C,B] . And that 'targets' list would represent \"predefined targets\" for this problem setup.  \n",
    "But it is important to understand how and where those targets are used. Using them in initial phase of the game ( \"game\" refers to one duel/truel match until final winner is known ) is straightforward - and \"initial phase\" means that all players are still in game.  \n",
    "In initial phase, player A will target C, when he miss then player B will target C, when B miss player C will target B, and when/if player C miss (not possible in case when pC=100%, but in general) then player A will again target player C and so on.  \n",
    "What happens when one player is eliminated?  Let's say player A hits player C, and only players A and B remain with player B on the move.  It is obvious that player B can not follow 'targets' any more, since playe C is eliminated.  \n",
    "But what if player could follow 'targets' in next phase (after one player is eliminated)? Let's say our predefined targets were [Miss, C, B] , meaning player A would intentionally miss and players B and C shoot each other. Assuming player B hits player C, should player A still shoot to miss? Obviously not, if playe A wants to win.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> <h4>'targets' only define what players will shoot in initial phase of game, while all players are still in game. As soon as one player is eliminated, 'targets' are not applicable any more.</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this holds true both for problem input ( predefined targets ) and problem result ( optimal targets ) - since \"optimal targets\" (as solution result), can be viewed as \"predefined targets\" that give best chance to win to all players.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often glossed over in Truel analyses, since for three players it is obvious that, when reduced to two players, optimal strategy is to shoot each other. Therefore specifying \"targets\" for truel completely define how each player will behave during entire game.  \n",
    "But it is not so for more players. If we have four players with targets=[ D,D,D,C ] and player D is eliminated, what will remaining three players target in next phase? Clearly, old targets are not applicable, but neither is simple 'shoot each other' as in duel case.  \n",
    "Therefore, predefined 'targets' parameter does <i>not</i> define all player choices in games with four or more players. To fully specify how four players should play it would need initial 'targets' while all are in game, and at least four additional 'targets' for each of four possible three player cases, and possibly even more than four - if player D is eliminated by player A (so now player B is on move), new targets could be [Miss,C,B,-]. But if player D was eliminated by player B instead ( so now player C is on move), it is possible that players would choose different target, for example [C,C,B,-]. At maximum that would mean 12 different possible 'targets' choices for three remaining players, depending on which player was eliminated and by who. This only gets more complex with 5+ players. So initial targets alone can not uniquely define rest of the game, unless we assume that, as soon as one player is eliminated, players will select targets for next phase in some predefined way. Such predefined way could be \"select highest threat\", or \"keep old target if alive, otherwise Miss\" or even \"all suicide\" etc ... but most of them would not be logical choices since players would tend to select targets that maximize their chance for victory. In any case, choice for targetsLater, or targets to apply after one player is eliminated, must be something applicable to all remaining players regardless of their number and of which players were eliminated. So it can not be \"target player C\" ( C could have been eliminated), or \"Miss\" (since it is pointless if all players choose to miss).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Valid options for **targetLater** would be:\n",
    "- Strongest : everyone target strongest player\n",
    "- Optimal:  everyone finds optimal target - this is most logical choice, and only one that allows to find real optimal targets for 4+ players, so it is default \n",
    "\n",
    "It follows that:\n",
    "> <h4> initial predefined 'targets' can define entire game only if we assume that, after one player is eliminated, remaining players will all select same type of target, specified in 'targetLater' - 'Optimal' should be logical choice</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><i>What are **\"optimal targets\"**  ?</i></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "From above discussion, it follows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> <h4> \"optimal targets\" are predefined targets that would maximize victory chance of all players.</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have shown that 'predefined targets' only define initial phase ( while all players are still in game), that also holds true for 'optimal targets'. Similarly, if new 'optimal targets' are selected once one player is eliminated ( for example, from 4 to 3 players ), that new optimal targets will be valid only until next player is eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>How to \"maximize victory chance of all players\" ?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Truel game is inherently **zero-sum game** ... if one player increase their chance to win, it must reduce some others player chance. Ultimately, sum of all players chance to win must be one:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{player} pWin\\, (player) = 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That presents problem to maximize victory chance for all players - if we maximize for player A, it will not be optimal for player B. But it is still possible to determine \"optimal\" targets if we make following assumptions:  \n",
    "* Assumption: players are able to detect which target players before them have selected. This is straightforward, and can either work by assuming players can 'see' what others shot, or by some other means like each player must announce his target before he shoots.\n",
    "* Assumption: it is possible to calculate win probabilities given predefined targets. This is even more straightforward, since it is main assumption of entire 'Truel' problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need some way to reduce complex problem of 'find optimal targets' to simpler problem of 'find probabilities to win for predefined targets', using above assumptions.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> <h4> finding optimal targets can be solved using form of **minimax approach**:  </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Last player to shoot (player C in three players example) will see/know targets of A and B ( as per assumptions ), and would be able to calculate his optimal target by calculating win probabilities for series of predefined targets, where those predefined targets will always have same targets selected by A and B, and his own targets will be his every possible target option. Let's say that A selected tgA=B, B to shoot tgB=A ... and possible targets for C are A/B/Miss. Player C will calculate three times:  \n",

    "If 'Random' option is available, where players can randomly shoot at any other player each round, it can be considered just as another option - as long as we know how to calculate win probabilities when Random is included in predefined targets, for example targets=[ Random, C, B ]\n",
    "\n",
    "Same approach can be applied for cases where only some players are allowed to search for optimal target, and other players are fixed to predefined targets. Lets say that we have:  \n",
    "- predefined targets = [ Optimal, C, Optimal ]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, player A and C can choose any target, but player B must shoot at player C. It only changes step for player B ( who does not have anything to choose ), and player A will need smaller number of total calculations to find optimum (3x1x3=9).  \n",
    "Basically, different options will change total number of possible 'predefined targets', but logic of choosing optimal targets after that should be same application of minimax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "> <h4> Optimal targets can be found by using minimax approach on all possible combinations of specific predefined targets  </h4>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Is same approach to find optimal targets applicable both in mathematical calculations and in simulations ?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, yes.  \n",
    "Simulations need to use this approach just as explained, by simulating all possible predefined targets combinations (27 in above example), and then applying this approach to find optimal target.  \n",
    "Mathematical calculation can do the same, but also has an option to optimize calculation and at same time calculate for optimal and for specific targets, as explained in later section.\n",
    "\n",
    "So simulating for targets=[Optimal, Optimal, Optimal ] will generally takes 27x more time than for specific predefined targets=[ Miss, C, B ]. Even more for more target options, for example if target options are { Others, Self, Miss, Random }, which means 5 target options ( A,B,C,Miss,Random), then it needs 5^3= 125 more calculations to find optimal solution than to find one specific solution using simulations. Using optimized mathematical calculations instead of simulation can avoid calculation of some of those Targets^Players, but would still need more time than single calculation needed for predefined specific targets ."

Similarly, if A select to target C, player B can choose among C+ rows at # 11,14,17  where best result for him is at #14 with 54%, so #14 gets B+, and in similar way #5\n",
    "    - when player A need to select his best target, he also have three options ( Miss, B , C ). For each of them he will get options marked by B+ from player B, so he needs to choose among three of those ( at rows #5, #14 and #23 ), and best win probability for player A among those is one at row #23 with 39.7% chance ( where A chose to Miss, and that row gets marked by A+)\n",
    "    - therefore A chooses as his target Miss , B chooses to target player C, anc C chooses to target player B  or targets = [ m C B ] as shown in row #23, with win probabilities [ 39.7%   38.1%   22.2% ], meaning 40% chance for player A to win, 38% for player B and just 22% for player C\n",

So we can explore truel for more players, and in this section we will do so for \"four players\" truel ( **quadruel**? )\n",

    "* simulations do not support correctly finding 'Optimal' target for reduced number of players\n",
    "\n",
    "While 'Strongest' option is rarely used anyway, and it would affect regular truel too, limitation for simulations is more affecting 'N>3' analysis when finding optimal targets. Namely, when simulation tries to find optimal target and it eliminate one player ( so it become truel instead of quadruel), it would have to now solve optimal target for that truel subcase - and that would be prohibitively slow to compute. For example, if we have 4 players with allowed targets [Others,Miss], it means each player have 3 target options and all 4 players have 3^4= 81 possible target combinations - so each simulation that search for optimal targets need to actually do 81 simulations, which already slows things down.  But if, in addition to that, we want to truly simulate for optimal targets, we would need to do same logic in every case when quadruel transforms to truel - we would need to do 3^3=27 full sub-simulations to determine which target was optimal for those truel cases.  Which would further slow down simulation 27 times. And all those slowdowns exponentially increase with larger number of allowed targets - so if [Others,Miss,Self,Random] is allowed, each player has 5 possible target choices and full simulation would need 5^4 * 5^3 sub-simulations, or 78 thousands(!) times longer execution than simple simulation with predefined targets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce that slowdown impact, simulation procedures here are skipping that optimal target search when player is eliminated - they only check those 81 options when all players are still alive, but do not multiply by those 27 when reduced to truels. Instead, they assume players will target 'Strongest' opponent when reduced to truel. That is reasonable assumption, and it is shown in above sections that in most cases 'target Strongest' is optimal choice. But not in all cases, so this assumption result in simulation not being able to truly find optimal targets without increasing simulation time 27 times ( or 125 times when more targets are allowed ). This would exponentially increase for 5 players etc. Note that this limitation does not affect regular \"truel\" simulations, since there reduction is to 2 players, and for them it is always optimal to shoot each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, mathematical calculation functions from this document are able to find true optimal targets even for 4+ players - when number of players is reduced from 4 to 3, those functions are solving for optimal targets on every combination of those 3 remaining players also. \n",

Both solvers and visualizers here are able to support any pHitC, but fact remains that any AB graph will show picture for **entire** player A/B range and some **fixed** player C hit probability.

It is also possible to get that rare edge case for other hit probabilities.  On AB graphs, such egde cases usually appear like \"glitches\" - individual pixels or lines that have different result color from surrounding areas.  Note that they are not errors - those are actual optimal results, at those positions and under selected ifEQ interpretation.\n",

For example, we can look at case presented in 4-players section, where player C hit chance was fixed at 50% and player D hit chance was fixed at 100% - and, in order to make those edge cases more visible, with lower resolution of 100x100 points:\n"
